# Data Analysis Project

## Overview 

Welcome to the repository for our advanced data analysis project. In this project, we delve into a comprehensive dataset to not only explore and understand the underlying patterns but also to apply sophisticated statistical techniques for forecasting future trends. Our work includes:

- **Calculating the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** We have computed the CDF to understand the probability distribution of our dataset's variables, giving us a clearer picture of the data's spread and variance.

- **Applying the ARIMA Model:** We have leveraged the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, a popular statistical method, to predict future points in the dataset. This time-series forecasting technique helps us in identifying patterns and projecting data trends into the future.

- **Outlier Detection and Removal:** Recognizing that outliers can significantly skew our analysis, we have implemented robust methods to identify and remove these anomalies from our dataset, ensuring that our predictions and insights are accurate and reliable.

Through these methods, we aim to provide a robust analytical approach that informs strategic decision-making and offers predictive insights into the dataset's future behavior.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- `lab1/`: Source code for analysis, including Python scripts and modules.
- `lab2/`: Source code for analysis, including Python scripts and modules.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for reproducing the analysis environment.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for navigating this repository.
- Dataset is a mongoDB collection which contains more that 1 million records.
